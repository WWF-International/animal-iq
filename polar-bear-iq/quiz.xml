		<question>
			Why don’t polar bears live in Antarctica?
		</question>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				The world’s oceans have never frozen from north to south
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				Temperatures in Antarctica drop too low
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				The penguin population forced polar bears out
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				They don’t have passports
			</choice>
		</choices>
		<explanation>
			Polar bears evolved relatively recently from grizzly bears somewhere around eastern Russia and Alaska. Because the world’s oceans have never frozen from north to south, polar bears have never had a way to travel to Antarctica.

		<question>
			Which is the greatest threat to polar bears?
		</question>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				Climate change
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				Industrial development
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				Conflict with humans
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				Unsustainable hunting
			</choice>
		</choices>
		<explanation>
			Industrial development, conflict with humans and unsustainable hunting are all threats, but climate change is the greatest one. Shorter ice seasons from climate change result in less time for polar bears to find food.

		<question>
			Human-polar bear conflicts are on the rise because ________.
		</question>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				The polar bear population has grown too large.
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				Melting sea ice forces bears onshore longer
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				More people are moving to the Arctic region
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				Polar bears are living farther south
			</choice>
		</choices>
		<explanation>
			Retreating ice means polar bears spend more time onshore and come into contact with people more often. WWF supports community projects in Alaska and Russia to prevent unintended encounters between bears and people.

		<question>
			Which is not a reason WWF tracks polar bear travels in the Arctic?
		</question>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				To determine the species' range
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				To learn how they behave with less sea ice
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				To locate populations for tour groups to view
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				To monitor the health of polar bears
			</choice>
		</choices>
		<explanation>
			Radio collars allow WWF to track polar bear movements to determine range and climate change’s effect on bear behavior. Scientists also perform health assessments when they put the collars on the bears.
